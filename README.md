# retrogamechecker

This is a Thinkful capstone project. The goal of this project is to create an app that allows you to search for a retro video game by title and view the latest market price as well as box art. The app will use the PriceCharting API for prices and will use the Twitch API for box art.

Nice to have:
Add links to buy/sell search item on eBay and/or Amazon.
